Security Monitoring Lab with Wazuh SIEM and AWS CloudTrail Integration
1. Overview
This document outlines the deployment and configuration of a security monitoring lab using the open-source Wazuh SIEM platform. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the integration of host-based intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring, brute-force attack detection, and cloud-based log ingestion from AWS CloudTrail.

The lab environment includes a Wazuh Manager hosted on Ubuntu, a Wazuh Agent installed on a Windows machine, a Kali Linux attack box for adversarial testing, and AWS services configured for cloud log monitoring. The setup provides visibility into both on-premises and cloud infrastructure, allowing for comprehensive security event detection and response.

2. Lab Architecture
2.1 Components
Wazuh Manager	Ubuntu Server VM	Collects, analyzes, and stores logs from connected agents
Wazuh Agent	Windows Host	Sends system logs and monitored events to the manager
Kali Linux	Kali VM	Used to simulate attacks for testing alert mechanisms
AWS CloudTrail	AWS Account	Records API calls and delivers logs to S3 for monitoring

2.2 Network Configuration
Ubuntu Server (Wazuh Manager): Bridged Adapter, internet-accessible

Windows Host (Wazuh Agent): Bridged Adapter, local network only

Kali Linux: Bridged Adapter, local network only

AWS: Internet-based, accessed via Ubuntu machine

The Ubuntu server also fetches CloudTrail logs from an AWS S3 bucket for cloud activity monitoring.

3. Prerequisites
VirtualBox installed on host system

Ubuntu Server 20.04+ installed in VirtualBox

Internet connectivity on the Ubuntu server

Windows host or VM with administrative access

Basic familiarity with Linux system administration

4. Installing the Wazuh Manager (Ubuntu)
4.1 Add the Wazuh GPG Key

curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh-archive-keyring.gpg

4.2 Download and Execute Wazuh Installation Script

curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh
sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a -i


After installation, access the dashboard:

https://<ubuntu-vm-ip>

Login credentials are displayed upon installation completion.

5. Installing the Wazuh Agent (Windows)

Download the Windows Wazuh Agent installer from the official Wazuh website.

6. Registering the Agent with the Manager
6.1 Generate Agent Key on Ubuntu

Run the following on the manager:

sudo /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents

Select A to add a new agent.

Assign a name (e.g., WindowsHost).

Choose E to extract the authentication key.

6.2 Apply the Key in the Windows Agent
Open the Wazuh Agent Manager GUI on Windows.

Paste the key.

Set the manager’s IP address (Ubuntu server).

Save and restart the agent service.

Verify that the agent is registered in the Wazuh Dashboard under "Agents".

7. File Integrity Monitoring (Windows Agent)
Wazuh monitors file changes using the Syscheck module.

7.1 Modify Configuration
Edit the agent’s configuration file:

C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf
Add the following within the <directories> block:

<directories realtime="yes">C:\Users\abc\Test</directories>

7.2 Restart Agent
Restart the Wazuh Agent service via the GUI or Services panel.

Wazuh will now monitor the specified directory in real time. File creation, modification, or deletion will trigger alerts in the dashboard.

8. Simulated Attack Scenarios (Kali Linux)

8.1 Brute Force Login Attempts
A brute-force SSH attack was performed using Hydra:

hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.x.x
Failed login attempts were detected by Wazuh, and alerts were generated for:

Multiple failed logins
Potential brute-force attack patterns

9. AWS CloudTrail Integration
9.1 Configure CloudTrail and S3
Created a new S3 bucket named wazuh-cloudtrail-logs.

Enabled CloudTrail in the AWS Console for all regions.

Configured CloudTrail to deliver logs to the S3 bucket.

9.2 Install AWS CLI

sudo apt update
sudo apt install awscli -y
aws configure

Provided:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region

Output format (json)

9.3 Fetch CloudTrail Logs with Wazuh
Checked if the integration script existed:


ls /var/ossec/integrations/aws/aws-s3.py

Executed the integration pull:

sudo /var/ossec/integrations/aws/aws-s3.py --bucket wazuh-cloudtrail-logs --trail_prefix AWSLogs/<account-id>/CloudTrail --only_logs --skip_on_error
Replaced <account-id> with actual AWS account number.

9.4 Result
After several AWS console operations (e.g., logging in, creating S3 buckets), CloudTrail logs were fetched and parsed by Wazuh.

Events like ConsoleLogin, CreateBucket, and DeleteUser appeared in the Cloud Events section of the Wazuh dashboard.

10. Conclusion
This lab demonstrates how Wazuh can be used to construct a hybrid security monitoring environment that spans on-premise systems and cloud services. It showcases key SIEM capabilities, including:

Centralized log analysis

Real-time file integrity monitoring

Intrusion detection via simulated attacks

Integration with AWS CloudTrail for visibility into cloud infrastructure

This environment enables effective security testing and event correlation across heterogeneous systems.
